Some gudielines to outline next steps

## Outline the market Launch
- What is the purpose of my product?
- Who are my customers? Artists, NFT artists, brands, ... who?
I would tend to stick to the plan of providing GANs to the genreal public. But at least to start, I need to narrow the scope.
- Whenever my scope is defined, how to launch?
I would probably start preparing anything barely working to provide the service.
It is more reasonable to think that at the beginning, I can advertise my work just on IG,
hiding the larger picture, i.e. providing GANs to the general public.
This can be done putting together the fashion and artist part. Note on fashion: it does not require any
additional person, can be done just by myself quite easily. Same can note be said for artists.

## General Purpose Models
Train some general purpose models on different domains
- [ ] Fashion
- [ ] Art
- [ ] Else?  

These models must be trained on ~10^5 images. An Ideal number is 50K.  
NOTE: with 50K images, it is likely that no augmentation is needed.
In such case, we could train just on StyleGan2 (can just disable augmentatoins?)

Dataset details:
- ~10^5 samples
- Resolution: 256 or 1024? It's being reaaaally slow the training for 1024 on 100kimg for beeple. I think that in this experimental part, I would need to iterate fast, so 256 is better to begin with. Than, for sure I'll move to 1024. 


## Steps (31 September deadline)
- Ask Landra availability for website, if it spreads.
- Train a GAN for shoes (just to begin) ==> this nike does not exist + style transfer?
Comunque in generale la gente che faroba AI a 10k followers ci arriva. Vedi (wallypdf)[https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/docs/_4xs10gaui.htm]
- Train a general purpose art GAN (need to make the dataset)
- Traina  GAN on Luca frames. Ideal
- Contact one artist at least for collabo
- Launch the IG with this material
- Movie Test? Really fascinating
